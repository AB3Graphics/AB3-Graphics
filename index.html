                <h3>Bio</h3>
                <p>My name is Alexander Byrd, III.</p>  
                <p>I am pursuing the long-term goal of producing and directing original animated series and films, drawing on my creative foundation to craft visual narratives that engage and inspire diverse audiences. This vision reflects not only my passion for storytelling but also my commitment to advancing into creative leadership roles within the animation and design industries.</p>
                <p>Currently, I serve as a marketing graphic designer in Dallas, Texas, where I focus on delivering high-quality creative work that strengthens brand identity and supports business growth. My experience in campaign development, branding, and visual communication has allowed me to contribute strategically while honing the skills necessary to take on larger creative challenges.</p>  
                <p>To prepare for these future responsibilities, I am dedicated to mastering a broad range of design and animation tools. I actively explore emerging software, programming languages, and web-based techniques to stay at the forefront of evolving technologies. This adaptability enables me to deliver innovative, efficient, and effective solutions in both design execution and broader creative strategy.</p>
                <p>My approach goes beyond visual design alone. I emphasize creative problem-solving to improve workflows, streamline processes, and enhance collaboration within teams. By merging my skills in graphic design, animation, and web development, I strive to contribute not only as a designer but as a forward-thinking creative partnerâ€”someone who can align artistry with organizational goals while shaping engaging stories that connect across media.</p>
                <p>Core belief: <span class="highlight">storytelling connects people across mediums.</span></p>
