        <p>Hello.  This is my test page.</p>
        <p>My name is Alexander Byrd, III.</p>  
        <p>I am originally from New Orleans, Louisiana and currently work as a marketing graphic designer in Dallas, Texas; however, I am also an aspiring animator deeply influenced by anime and comics.</p>
        <p> With a natural thirst for knowledge, I enjoy exploring new and interesting graphic design elements and visual storytelling mediums that shape my artistic perspective and the way I approach design.</p>  
        <p>I am taking this class to broaden my abilities as a graphic designer by expanding my web design skills by learning programming languages and web techniques. My goal is to direct and produce my own animated series, so I am hoping to merge my graphic design, animation, and web design abilities to become a better designer and animator by solving problems with creative solutions and lateral thinking.</p>
